# End-to-end-HR-Attrition
An end-to-end HR Attrition machine learning project involves analyzing historical employee data to predict and understand factors contributing to attrition.
The Machine learning steps taken include:
* Data preprocessing
* Feature Selection
* Model Training (Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
* Model Evaluation
* Deployment for ongoing attrition prediction and Management.

## End-to-End Best Practices Used to Execute the project are as follows:
* GitHub and Code Set-Up
* Outline Project Structure, Logging and Exception Handling
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model Training
* Data Ingestion
* Data Transformation
* Model Trainer
* Predict Pipeline
* Model Deployment
